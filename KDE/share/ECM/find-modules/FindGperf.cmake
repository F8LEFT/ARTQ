# FindGperf
# -----------
#
# Try to find GNU gperf.
#
# If the gperf executable is not in your PATH, you can provide
# an alternative name or full path location with the ``Gperf_EXECUTABLE``
# variable.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
# ``Gperf_FOUND``
#     True if gperf is available.
#
# ``Gperf_EXECUTABLE``
#     The gperf executable.
#
# If ``Gperf_FOUND`` is TRUE, it will also define the following imported
# target:
#
# ``GPerf::Gperf``
#     The gperf executable.
#
# and the following public function:
#
#   ecm_gperf_generate(<GperfInput> <OutputFile> <OutputVariable>
#                      [GENERATION_FLAGS <flags>])
#
# Run ``gperf`` on ``<GperfInput>`` to generate ``<OutputFile>``, adding it to
# the ``<OutputVariable>`` variable which contains the source for the target
# where ``<OutputFile>`` is going to be built.  The optional
# ``GENERATION_FLAGS`` argument is needed to pass extra parameters to
# ``gperf`` (note you cannot override that way the output file).
#
# A simple invocation would be:
#
#   ecm_gperf_generate(simple.gperf ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/simple.h MySources)
#
# Since 5.35.0.
