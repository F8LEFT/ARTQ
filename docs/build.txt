How to build:

Before building this project, you must conform that you have installed
the latest Qt program(Qt5.9), java and cmake.

git clone https://github.com/F8LEFT/ARTQ

cd ARTQ

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=STRING=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/qtbuildpath  --build ..

make AndroidReverseToolkit

Or just use QtCreator to build it. Use QtCreator to open ${ART}/CmakeLists.txt, and build.

Ps: If you are building ART in Windows Platform, you need to generate dependency
file after building.

windeployqt --release AndroidReverseToolkit
